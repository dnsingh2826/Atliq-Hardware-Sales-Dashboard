END-TO-END PROJECT
This dataset contains the information on the sales of a hardware company named 'Atliq Hardware', which currently only operates in India. The dataset contains the data from 2017 to 2020. 
There are 5 different tables which in data format, represents a star formation. 
The datset is in form of a .sql file, so we have first uploaded the file onto the MySQL server. 
Then connecting the MySQL server and POWER BI, we imported the dataset into POWER BI. Then, we have analyzed the data and created a dashboard for the dataset using POWER BI tools to measure the growth in sales of the hardware store. 
Being a business data anayst, the course provided with me my first hand-on experience of an end-to-end project, where we deploy the dataset to the workspace, and upload it to the cloud where the stakeholders can access it and review it. 
Upon their feedback, the feeback is revised regularly and the dashboard keeps changing as more & more data is stored in the dataset.
